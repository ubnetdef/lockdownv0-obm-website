            <h4>What Happened</h4>
            <p>Our ex-System Administrator, <em>Hoban "Wash" Washburne</em>, got extremely drunk one night at the local bar and accidently told everyone his password. At <strong>April 8th, 8:00PM</strong>, we noticed unauthorized access across our entire network from various countries &mdash; China, Russia, and North Korea.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h4>How We're Fixing It</h4>
            <p>After the detection of the unauthorized access, we immediately shutdown our entire infrastructure.  We are hiring a local Incident Response team to secure our network as soon as possible. We expect to be at full business operation once the new Incident Response team arrives.</p>
