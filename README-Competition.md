Office of Blue Team Management
========

This is the Office of Blue Team Management website.  This website was coded by Jonny Miller (often goes by "Zero Cool" or "Crash Override"), while he was on an unpaid internship with the agency.  It is coded in PHP due to how easy it is to pick up, and make a website with.
